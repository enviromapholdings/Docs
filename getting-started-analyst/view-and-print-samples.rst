Viewing Samples within a Collection
------------------------------------

Right click on the collection that you would like to View Samples for. From the context menu, select *View Samples*.

.. attention::

	Screenshot Placeholder: Context menu with View Samples visible
    
.. note::

	If this is the first time this collection has been opened, you will first need to confirm the samples. Click the **Save Changes** button on the *Select Samples* popup to continue, or proceed to -`Adding or Editing Samples for a Collection`_ to make any changes.

A window will popup, showing all of the samples defined for this collection. You can view their placement on the building map by selecting the *Show Maps* button on the lower right, and can revert back to the sample list view by selecting the button once more, which will now be labeled *Show Samples*

Adding or Editing Samples for a Collection
--------------------------------------------

.. note::

	If this collection does not have samples defined from the collection wizard, you will have to add any samples you wish to include by using the *Add Samples* dropdown in the top-right hand corner of the popup window.

If there are any changes you would like to make to the samples listed, you may click the sideways arrow or the pencil icon to the left of the sample you wish to edit. If you want to delete a particular sample, you may click the red X to the right of the sample you wish to remove.

.. note::

    any changes made through this process will not affect any other collections. If you wish to make a change to how a collection's samples are chosen, contact your administrator.

Printing Samples for a Collection
-----------------------------------

When Viewing samples for a particular collection, you have the option to print off the samples. You can select the *Print* button in the lower right of the popup window, or the *Print w/Maps* button to include an image of the samples' placement within the building along with your samples.
Both methods of printing will bring up a separate browser window or tab. Most browsers will attempt to walk you through printing on the default printer for the computer you are using. If you have trouble using your browser's print dialog, please contact your administrator.
