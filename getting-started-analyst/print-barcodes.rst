Printing Labels from Multiple Collections

	This method only works for collections that already have confirmed samples. If you haven't already confirmed the samples via the *Select Samples* popup, then this method will not work for you.

Begin by left clicking on two or more collections that contain samples you want to print.

.. tip::

	Having trouble selecting a collection? When selecting the collection, try clicking on the collection's text and keeping your mouse still.

When ready to print, right click on one of the selected collections and from the context menu select **Print All Barcodes**.
